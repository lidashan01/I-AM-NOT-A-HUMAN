			</section>

			<section id="play">

			<section id="updates">
				<h2>Updates and Hotfixes</h2>
				<h3>Latest Known Issues and Fix Status</h3>
				<p>We summarize official hotfixes such as save/softlock fixes and controller prompt updates. Each entry links back to the original Steam Community post for verification.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Learn the Core Loop</h2>
				<p>By day you examine guests, budgeting limited energy to inspect teeth, nails, eyes, demeanor, and context. Night brings the knock. Humans may show false positives; Visitors won’t always show every tell. Decisions are probabilistic, not mechanical—this is where the horror breathes.</p>
				<p>The TV broadcast introduces new tells as nights pass, so your checklist evolves alongside the threat. Isolation is not an option: without other humans, the house—and you—won’t survive to see the ending you want.</p>
				<p>Our guides favor minimal spoilers. We present short checklists and fold away specifics for those who prefer to discover.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Why This Hub</h2>
				<p>Fragmented tips waste time and ruin tension. This hub consolidates verified facts from Wikipedia, Steam, and Metacritic with hands‑on strategies. It respects your attention and your playthrough.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Accurate: we cite official sources and community posts.</li>
					<li>Practical: checklists you can apply immediately.</li>
					<li>Low‑spoiler: expandable details when you want them.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>What Exactly Is “No, I’m not a Human”?</h2>
				<p>At its core, this is a first‑person anxiety horror about <em>judgment under scarcity</em>. The premise is simple but cruel: the sun scorches the world by day; at night <strong>Visitors</strong> that mimic humans roam. You live in a small house at the edge of town. People knock, beg to come in, and you must decide whether they stay, whether they leave, or whether you pull the trigger. The loop blends slow‑burn investigation with sudden, high‑stakes choices. For verified background and release facts, see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No,_I%27m_not_a_Human">Wikipedia overview</a> and the official <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3180070/No_Im_not_a_Human/">Steam store page</a>.</p>
				<p>Unlike traditional survival horror, there are no maze‑like levels or monster chases. The tension is psychological: interpreting imperfect signals, living with consequences, and managing a dwindling pool of safe options. Choices compound over days, and small errors—like misreading a tell or wasting energy on a low‑yield inspection—can echo into your finale.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>How Decisions Work</h2>
				<p>Every day you receive a fresh <strong>news broadcast</strong> that introduces or reinforces a new “tell”. Some tells are physical (teeth, nails, eye condition), others are behavioral or contextual (word choice, timing, smell, inconsistencies). Importantly, <em>humans can exhibit a tell by coincidence</em>, and Visitors won’t always present all tells. Certainty is rare. The game rewards pattern‑building across categories rather than hunting for any single tell.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Energy economy:</strong> examinations cost energy; finishing the day requires spending it all. Plan a high‑signal order and avoid busywork.</li>
					<li><strong>Deferred risk:</strong> sparing a suspected Visitor may doom a guest overnight. Killing a human by mistake has no direct mechanical punishment, but it can remove useful allies and change late‑game safety.</li>
					<li><strong>Information growth:</strong> your checklist evolves with the nightly broadcast, so optimal routines change over time.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>FEMA and Other Special Encounters</h2>
				<p>Beyond ordinary guests, several encounter types punctuate the loop. A <strong>FEMA worker</strong> may demand that a random guest be taken for testing; an <strong>Intruder</strong> can force his way in; a <strong>Vigilante</strong> may turn suspicion back toward you. These events test your preparation: a house with too few reliable humans becomes fragile, while a house with poorly vetted occupants turns lethal. We break down FEMA timing, outcomes and planning on the dedicated <a href="/wiki/visitors/fema-notice/">FEMA Notice</a> page.</p>
				<p>The existence and cadence of these encounters are documented on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No,_I%27m_not_a_Human">Wikipedia article</a> and further discussed in community threads on the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3180070">Steam Community hub</a>.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Release, Price and Where to Buy</h2>
				<p>The PC version launched on <strong>September 15, 2025</strong>. The official storefront is the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3180070/No_Im_not_a_Human/">Steam store page</a>, where you can verify current pricing, supported languages, achievements and system requirements. Console versions for <strong>PS5</strong> and <strong>Xbox Series X|S</strong> are planned after the PC launch; timing updates are usually mirrored in press coverage and the Steam news feed. For a consolidated platform view, see our <a href="/wiki/platforms/">Platforms</a> page.</p>
				<p>We recommend purchasing via official storefronts only. Third‑party downloads risk malware and will not receive hotfixes. Our <a href="/download/">Download</a> page explains safe install steps and notes on patch sizes.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Languages, Fonts and Localization</h2>
				<p>Language support and font details are listed on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3180070/No_Im_not_a_Human/">Steam store</a>. Community posts note updates such as a <em>DotGothic</em> font switch for Japanese UI and a revised Korean character atlas; scan the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3180070">Steam Community</a> for recent localization hotfixes. We mirror critical changes on our <a href="/updates/">Updates</a> page.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>System Requirements and Performance Tips</h2>
				<p>Per the store listing, the minimum PC spec targets Windows 10, an Intel Core i5 class CPU, 2 GB RAM and a GTX 960 GPU. While the game is not hardware‑intensive, you will benefit from keeping drivers up to date and disabling background overlays to avoid input conflicts. Full specs and language lists live on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3180070/No_Im_not_a_Human/">Steam page</a>.</p>
				<p>If you play on a high‑DPI laptop, force the GPU for the executable in your graphics control panel to prevent low‑power stutter. Windowed‑fullscreen can mitigate alt‑tab issues on some setups.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Controller and Input Notes</h2>
				<p>Early posts on the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3180070">Steam Community hub</a> mention prompt icon glitches with specific controllers and advice to disable Steam Input when using certain gamepads. If you mix mouse‑keyboard and controller during a session, UI hints can desync; pick one input for the run to avoid confusion. We track these items on the <a href="/updates/">Updates</a> page with links back to official notes.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Save System and Softlocks</h2>
				<p>Hotfix posts describe edge cases in which saving at the start of a night and reloading could cause nightly guests to disappear, effectively softlocking progress. The developers have shipped fixes; if you still encounter issues, verify files and avoid saving in transitional moments. See the Community hub for the latest hotfix notes and our summarized timeline on <a href="/updates/">Updates</a>.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Critic and Community Reception</h2>
				<p>Reception centers on the game’s oppressive atmosphere, the moral discomfort of killing on suspicion, and the way minor clues gain weight over time. For an aggregate snapshot, check the Metacritic listing for the PC version: <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/no-im-not-a-human/">Metacritic — No, I’m not a Human</a>. Community impressions and guides are concentrated in the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3180070">Steam Community hub</a>, which is also the best place to report bugs directly.</p>
